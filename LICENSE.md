Subject to clauses [3.3](#3.3) and [3.4](#3.4) below, the Licensor grants to the Licensee and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free licence, commencing on the relevant Quote Effective Date, to permit Licensee Developers to use the Software Materials (including taking all the actions permitted by clause [3.4](#3.4) below) in accordance with these Terms, subject to the limit on the number of permitted Licensee Developers set out in the relevant Quote.

For the purposes of this limit, each developer modifying TypeScript/JavaScript code as part of the creation or Modification of an Application's user interface, which user interface creation or Modification uses the Software shall constitute a separate Licensee Developer. For example, if the Licensee has five developers working with TypeScript/JavaScript code with respect to the creation or Modification of the user interface of an Application and such creation or Modification uses the Software, but only two developers are directly working with the Software, all five developers will be counted as Licensee Developers.
